I deployed my application on Vercel, but I utilized Multer in my project to temporarily store files on the server. However, Vercel does not permit temporary file storage. Therefore, if anyone uses this application and attempts to upload an image, it will result in an error.

To circumvent this issue, you can also check out the Render deployment link: https://blog-app-0qto.onrender.com/. However, please note that clicking on the link may take at least 30 seconds for the website to load. Please be patient.
